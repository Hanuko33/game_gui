# Game_gui 
###### inside name: game_new
This is a game made with sdl2 and c++
it has (almost) infinite worlds, with 3 types of terrain, stone ground, dirt ground, and tree. In the future there will be propobly a lot more!

This is still early stage (alpha/beta)

also, I'm not trying to make this game windows, or mac compatible (focusing on linux, and the game itself for now)
